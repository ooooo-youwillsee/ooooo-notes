my room. but I did not write a single card.</p></blockquote><h1 id=lesson-4-2022117>lesson 4, 2022.11.7</h1><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve just received a letter from my brother. Tim. He is in Australia.He has been there for six months. He is an

but Joe wins every time. Bill&rsquo;s garden is larger than Joe&rsquo;s. Bill works harder than Joe and grows more flowers and
vegetables, but Joe&rsquo;s garden is more interesting. He has made neat paths and has built a wooden bridge over a pool. I
like gardens too, but I do not like hard work. Every year I enter for the garden competition too, and I always win a
little prize for the worst garden in the town.</p></blockquote><h1 id=lesson-9-20221114>lesson 9. 2022.11.14</h1><blockquote><p>On Wednesday evening, we went to the Town Hall. It was the last day of the year and a large crowd of people had
gathered under the Town Hall clock. It would strike twelve in twenty minutes&rsquo; time. Fifteen minutes passed and then, at
five to twelve, the clock stopped. The big minute hand did not move. We waited and waited, but nothing happened.
Suddenly someone shouted, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s two minutes past twelve, the clock has stopped.&rdquo; I looked at my watch, it was true. The
big clock refused to welcome the New Year. At that moment, everyone began to laugh and sing.</p></blockquote></div><div id=comments><div id=gitalk class=comment></div><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by <a href=https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk></a>Gitalk</a>.</noscript></div></div></div></main><footer class=footer><div class=footer-container><div class=footer-line>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer" title="Hugo 0.105.0">Hugo</a> | Theme - <a href=https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer" title="LoveIt 0.2.11"><i class="far fa-kiss-wink-heart fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i> LoveIt</a></div><div class=footer-line itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/CreativeWork><i class="far fa-copyright fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i><span itemprop=copyrightYear>2022</span><span class=author itemprop=copyrightHolder>&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/ooooo-youwillsee target=_blank>ooooo-youwillsee</a></span>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<span class=license><a rel="license external nofollow noopener noreffer" href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ target=_blank>CC BY-NC 4.0</a></span></div></div></footer></div><div id=fixed-buttons><a href=# id=back-to-top class=fixed-button title="Back to Top"><i class="fas fa-arrow-up fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i>
